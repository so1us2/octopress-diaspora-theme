### Octopress Bootstrap theme for Diaspora sites ###
***
This a theme I tweaked heavily to work as add-on static pages to be generated by Octopress and added to the "public" directory of any Diaspora pod. This is usefull if you wish to create themed ToS, Privacy, About, and other blog pages to be linked from the landing page of your Diaspora pod. If you wish to see this theme in action please visit the pages linked in the navbar of this Diaspora pod hosted at <https://hfase.com> or directly at <https://hfase.com/blog/>
***
Adding this theme to your Octopress is very easy, just use the following commands from the root-directory of your Octopress repo.

```git submodule add git@github.com:hfase01/octopress-diaspora-theme.git .themes/bootstrap```

Install the theme;

```rake install[bootstrap]```

Update the theme if needed;

```cd ./themes/boostrap && git pull```
